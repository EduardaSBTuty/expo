This is a project skeleton that follows the structure of react-native-builder-bob output since ~Q1 2025 (with package.json exports).

It contains dummy library code in `index.js` files, and also contains a config plugin specified via `app.plugin.js` that `resolvePluginForModule()` should resolve to, but the user forgot to export `app.plugin.js`, and so the resolution should error with an actionable message.
